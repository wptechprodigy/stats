# Stats for English Premier League 2018/19 Season

A NodeJS + Typescript project to read, parse, analyse and make a report of a csv file of the EPL 2018/19 football (soccer) season.

Not sure yet if the report will be presented on a UI but we'll find out.

## First method

A naive approach is first employed and we consoled the number of matches (both
**Home** and **Away**) won by Chelsea FC in the season.

Here's a screenshot of the result:

The very first commit of code does it well...bad though!
